## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.8+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository and navigate into it**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arya182-ui/Yt-Downloder
   cd Yt-Downloder
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example template. This file is used for your secret keys and local configuration.
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # On Windows
   copy .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Now, open the new `.env.local` file and add your hCaptcha keys, which you can get for free from hcaptcha.com.

   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup backend**

   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Ubuntu/Debian)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start:
   - Frontend on http://localhost:5173

## Error Facing : Cookie Expiry & Manual Refresh
To support region-restricted or age-gated YouTube content, I integrated browser-exported cookies into the backend.
But here's the reality of production:

üìâ These cookies expire fast, often within hours.
üîÅ There's no built-in refresh ‚Äî requiring manual re-export & deployment.
üí• This leads to frontend errors like this:

üß† Lesson learned: Authentication is not just about passing headers ‚Äî it‚Äôs about session lifecycle management. A ‚Äúworking‚Äù cookie today might break your app tomorrow.

## License

‚ö†Ô∏è This public instance is for demo purposes only. Video download features are subject to rate limits and may break due to expired authentication cookies. Please use responsibly.
